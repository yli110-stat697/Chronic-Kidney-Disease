# Chronic-Kidney-Disease

In this repo, I try to apply the state-of-art machine learning algorithms **XGBoost** to the *chronic kidney disease* dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/chronic_kidney_disease#).

This was inspired by the DataCamp XGBoost course I have taken this week.
